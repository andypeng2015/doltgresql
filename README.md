# DoltgreSQL is Git for Data!

DoltgreSQL is a SQL database that you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push
and pull just like a Git repository.

Connect to DoltgreSQL just like any PostgreSQL database to read or modify schema
and data. Version control functionality is exposed in SQL via system
tables, functions, and procedures.

Git versions files. DoltgreSQL versions tables. It's like Git and PostgreSQL had a
baby.
